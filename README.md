# dashboard-page
A dashboard page using pure html and css

This mini project aims to show my skills in css grid blended with flexbox for layouts of web pages.
All the components are responsive on a desktop screen.

Not only does this page showcase layouts but designing components using pure html and css as seen on the live page and code.
